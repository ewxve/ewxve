# 🌏 About Nik

I'm a software developer for the USAF, currently working on my BA in Computer Science and then I'll be working on an MA in Cognitive Linguistics. I most frequently work in C# and Python and I'm a strong proponent of open source. When I'm not working on projects, I like rock climbing, learning foreign languages, and making music.

# 🎫 Current Project

I'm developing a language testing software that can identify an English learner's figurative "fault line"- as in, if we rank every word in the English lexicon by the frequency at which that word appears in daily life, we can graph an English learner's proficiency and where their English abilities start to waiver. I do this by combining mathematics and various research papers from the field of Cognitive Linguistics, then turning it into a Python program. You can check out the program in my pinned repository here on GitHub :)
